---> MINIKUBE NOTES:

If you are running Minikube from a fresh install, please install the Ingress controller in order to be able to connect and test 'zeebo' locally.

You can do this by running the command below:

$ minikube addons enable ingress

After installing the ingress controller, you can test locally via curl by following these steps:

1. Get the ingress IP using "kubectl get ing" like in the example below:

$ kubectl get ing
NAME      CLASS     HOSTS      ADDRESS          PORTS   AGE
zeebo-go  <none>    {{ .Values.ingress.hostname }}   192.168.99.100   80      78m

2. From the HOSTS address you see above, run curl using the same hostname set by this ingress:

$ curl http://192.168.99.100 -vH "Host: {{ .Values.ingress.hostname }}"

The reponse will be something like this, with only a single dot in the body:

*   Trying 192.168.99.100...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 192.168.99.100 (192.168.99.100) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: {{ .Values.ingress.hostname }}
> User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
> Accept: */*
